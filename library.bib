@article{Ostrom1998,
abstract = {E extensive empirical evidence and theoretical developments in multiple disciplines stimulate a need to expand the range of rational choice models to be used as a foundation for the study of social dilemmas and collective action. After an introduction to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas through collective action, the remainder of this article is divided into six sections. The first briefly reviews the theoretical predictions of currently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second section summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by extensive experimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to show how individuals achieve results that are "better than rational" by building conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and trust can help to overcome the strong temptations of short-run self-interest. The fourth section raises the possibility of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops an initial theoretical scenario, and the final section concludes by examining the implications of placing reciprocity, reputation, and trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action. L et me start with a provocative statement. You would not be reading this article if it were not for some of our ancestors learning how to undertake collective action to solve social dilemmas. Successive generations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-edge about how to instill productive norms of behavior in their children and to craft rules to support collective action that produces public goods and avoids "trage-dies of the commons."' What our ancestors and con-temporaries have learned about engaging in collective action for mutual defense, child rearing, and survival is not, however, understood or explained by the extant theory of collective action. Yet, the theory of collective action is the central subject of political science. It is the core of the justifi-cation for the state. Collective-action problems per-vade international relations, face legislators when de-vising public budgets, permeate public bureaucracies, and are at the core of explanations of voting, interest group formation, and citizen control of governments in a democracy. If political scientists do not have an empirically grounded theory of collective action, then Elinor Ostrom is Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science; Co-Director, Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis; and Co-Director, Center for the Study of Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change; Indiana Universtiy, Bloomington, IN 47408-3895. for their comments on earlier drafts and to Patty Dalecki for all her excellent editorial and moral support. 1 The term "tragedy of the commons" refers to the problem that common-pool resources, such as oceans, lakes, forests, irrigation systems, and grazing lands, can easily be overused or destroyed if property rights to these resources are not well defined (see Hardin 1968).},

abstract = {This article revisits Akerlof's (1970) classic adverse-selection market and asks the following question: do greater information asymmetries reduce the gains from trade? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is no. Better information on the selling side worsens the " buyer's curse, " thus lowering demand, but may shift supply as well. Whether trade increases or decreases depends on the relative sizes of these effects. A characterization is given. On the other hand, improving the buyer's information—i.e., making private information public—unambiguously improves trade so long as market demand is downward sloping.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a firm's choice between borrowing from a single bank and from two banks. The focus is on how this decision affects banks' equilibrium monitoring intensities and loan rates. Two-bank lending suffers from duplication of effort and sharing of monitoring benefits, but it benefits from diseconomies of scale in monitoring. Thus, two-bank lending involves lower monitoring but not necessarily higher loan rates than single-bank lending. The optimal borrowing structure balances the benefit of monitoring for the firm in terms of higher success probability of the project against its drawbacks of lower expected private return and higher total monitoring costs. In contrast to the previous theoretical literature, the model lays down an explanation for the empirical observation that multiple-bank lending does not unambiguously increase loan rates or firms' quality, in particular in small business lending. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

To break that simultaneity, this paper uses prison overcrowding litigation in a state as an instrument for changes in the prison population. The resulting elasticities are two to three times greater than those of previous studies. A one-prisoner reduction is associated with an increase of fifteen Index I crimes per year. While calculations of the costs of crime are inherently uncertain, it appears that the social benefits associated with crime reduction equal or exceed the social costs of incarceration for the marginal prisoner.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to examine the effect of inequality on crime rates in a unique context, Mexico's drug war. The analysis exploits an original dataset containing inequality and crime statistics on more than 2000 Mexican municipalities over a 20-year period. To uncover the causal effect of inequality on crime, we use an instrumental variable for the Gini coefficient that combines the initial income distribution at the municipality level with national trends. Our estimates indicate that a one-point increment in the Gini coefficient between 2007 and 2010 translates into an increase of more that 36{\%} in the number of drug-related homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. The fact that the effect found during the drug war is substantially greater is likely caused by the rise in rents to be extracted through crime and an expansion in the employment opportunities in the illegal sector through the proliferation of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), accompanied by a decline in legal job opportunities and a reduction in the probability of being caught given the resource constraints faced by the law enforcement system. Combined, the latter factors made the expected benefits of criminal activity shift in a socially undesirable direction after 2007.Sector Board: Poverty (POV).},

abstract = {"We hold many assumptions about police work -- that it is the responsibility of the state, or that police officers be given the right to kill in the name of public safety or self-defense. But in The Killing Consensus, Graham Denyer Willis shows how in São Paulo, Brazil, killing and the arbitration of 'normal' killing in the name of social order is actually conducted by two groups--the police and organized crime--both operating by parallel logics of murder. Based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork, Willis traces how homicide detectives categorize two types of killing: the first resulting from 'resistance' to police arrest (which is often broadly defined), and the second at the hands of a crime 'family' known as the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC). Death at the hands of police happens regularly, while the PCC's centralized control and strict moral code among criminals has also routinized killing, ironically making the city feel safer for most residents. In a fractured urban security, where killing mirrors patterns of inequitable urbanization and historical exclusion on class, gender and racial lines, Denyer Willis' research finds that the city's cyclical periods of peace and violence can best be understood through an unspoken but mutually observed consensus on the right to kill. This consensus hinges on common notions and street level practices of who can die, where, how, and by whom, revealing an empirically distinct configuration of authority that Denyer Willis calls sovereignty by consensus"--Provided by publisher.

However, these literatures also suffer from many diverse and conflicting approaches to estimation, uncertainty, theoretical analysis, and practical advice. In this paper, we propose a unified perspective on matching as a method of nonparametric preprocessing for improving parametric methods. This approach makes it possible for researchers to preprocess their data (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer with this paper) and then to apply whatever familiar statistical techniques they would have used anyway. Under our approach, instead of using matching to replace existing methods, we use it to make existing methods work better, such as by giving more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.

abstract = {Anti-insurgent militias and states attempt to erode insurgent groups' capacities and co-opt insurgent fighters by promising and providing benefits. They do so to create a perception that the insurgency is unraveling and to harness inside information to prosecute more effective counterinsurgency campaigns. Why do some insurgents defect to a paramilitary group and others exit the war by demobilizing, while still others remain loyal to their group? This article presents the first empirical analysis of these questions, connecting insurgents' motivations for joining, wartime experi- ences, and organizational behavior with decisions to defect. A survey of ex-combatants in Colombia shows that individuals who joined for ideological reasons are less likely to defect overall but more likely to side-switch or demobilize when their group deviates from its ideological precepts. Among fighters who joined for economic reasons, political indoctrination works to decrease their chances of demobilization and defection to paramilitaries, while opportunities for looting decrease economically motivated combatants' odds of defection.},

abstract = {This Article discusses the deterrence of crime through sanctions. It begins with a brief intellectual history of deterrence theory in the work of Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham, two Enlightenment philosophers who created the conceptual foundation for later deterrence and rational choice theory. Although a prominent intellectual current by the end of the 1700s, interest in deterrence and rational choice based theories of criminal offending was later eclipsed by more biologically and psychologically based explanations. Interest in deterrence theory and the deterrent effect of legal sanctions was not rekindled until the mid-1960s. This Article discusses the particular and important role of the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology in publishing the works of both those who were highly critical of deterrence theory and those who wished to keep it alive, though vividly aware of the lack of any empirical support for it. This Article discusses the theoretical connections that are presumed by the deterrence process and briefly reviews some important empirical studies pertaining to each of those presumed causal connections. The empirical evidence leads to the conclusion that there is a marginal deterrent effect for legal sanctions, but this conclusion must be swallowed with a hefty dose of caution and skepticism; it is very difficult to state with any precision how strong a deterrent effect the criminal justice system provides. At the very least, there is a great asymmetry between what is expected of the legal system through deterrence and what the system delivers. There is greater confidence that non-legal factors are more effective in securing compliance than legal threats. It is argued that the empirical evidence does support the belief that criminal offenders are rational actors, in that they are responsive to the incentives and disincentives associated with their actions, but that the criminal justice system, because of its delayed imposition of punishment, is not well constructed to exploit this rationality.},

Each subject could invest resources provided by the experimenter in either a private good, which returned a fixed amount of money to the individual per token invested, or a public good. The public good returned money to the group and, beyond a given provision point, returned much more money per token invested than did the private good. All money from the public good was divided according to a preset formula. Thus, sub- jects could "free ride" on the public good, if other group members in- vested in it, by taking their share of it and keeping their own resources for themselves. Groups were randomly designated as either large or small, and unequal or equal in the distribution of interest and of re- sources within the group. Results indicate that the effects of free riding were much weaker than would be predicted from most eco- nomic theory. As predicted from the theory, however, small groups containing an individual whose interest in the public good exceeded the cost of its provision (i.e., small, unequal-interest groups) invested more in the public good than any other type of group. No additional significant effects of group size or interest or resource distribution were found. It},

This article provides a comprehensive review of theories of crime and presents an empirical analysis of social violence in Latin America from 1980 to 2010. The literature often emphasizes one theoretical approach over others and existing explanations are seen as competitive rather than complementary. Yet, the empirical findings of this study support different explanations and illustrate how considering different theoretical approaches helps improve our knowledge on social violence phenomena. The results from different estimation methods reveal that youth bulges, female workforce, and post-conflict states are positively associated with social violence, as measured by homicide rates. The results also show that states' efforts to strengthen judicial system capacity and increase school attendance can promote peace. Moreover, while drug producers and/or transit countries are not systematically related to social violence, money-laundering countries experience higher homicide rates, suggesting that not all dimensions of drug-markets increase violence. Whereas Latin America as a whole has experienced few episodes of civil wars in the past decades, the findings suggest that several factors affecting the onset of civil wars also influence other forms of non-political violence such as social violence. This echoes earlier calls in the literature on the necessity of bridging conflict and criminology research.},

This research contributes to an understanding of the escalation and diffusion of drug violence in Mexico from 2000 to 2010 by formalizing the interactions between the state and organized criminals and by relying on a large database of event data containing more than 1.6 million observations. Results based on spatial econometrics provide evidence of the spatial diffusion of violence. In congruence with the theoretical expectations, the results show that the disruptive effect of law enforcement is an important catalyst for the intensification of violence between criminal organizations, especially when deployed in areas hosting a high concentration of criminal groups. This relationship holds for a broad menu of violent and nonviolent law enforcement tactics. The analysis also reveals that other broadly held factors (international, geographic, and socioeconomic characteristics) have a modest effect on the dynamics of drug-related violence.},

abstract = {An exploratory investigation compares prison gangs in South Africa with those in the U.S. Data were gathered in January 1988 from a brief survey instrument completed by the area commanders of the 3 largest prisons operated by the South African Department of Correctional Services. Comparative data for the U.S. were drawn from the 1994 Adult Corrections Survey. As in the U.S., South African correctional officers were believed to face a greater danger from gangs than police officers. Incarceration was not considered to be an effective deterrent to gang membership. To combat gangs, the area managers in South Africa emphasized social measures such as counseling, dealing with complaints and requests, work teams, and motivation programs. This stands in contrast to U.S. prisons, where transfers of gang members and leaders is the favored response, along with segregation, lockdown and other punitive measures.},

Data were gathered from the police contact histories of 325 males born in Racine, WI in 1949 who maintained continual residence there until age 25. Some evidence emerged to support a specific deterrence hypothesis. However, the specific deterrent effect of arrest operated differently for novice and experienced offenders. Among novices, arrest was somewhat more likely to terminate their criminal careers. Among those more experienced, arrest significantly reduced future rates of offending. The evidence is more consistent with a specific deterrence theory than a labeling perspective.},

abstract = {This article explores the relationship between the historical events surrounding the legal abolition of slavery, and the widespread and often longstanding practices that fall under the rubric of "contemporary forms of slavery." Slavery is routinely dismissed as an historical artifact, but this complacent viewpoint obscures a range of complex and enduring problems. In this article, I suggest that one of the main limitations of an emerging literature on contemporary slavery is a recurrent tendency to downplay or disregard the historical dimensions of current problems, in favor of a problematic bifurcation between "new" and "old." Employing a macro-historical perspective, I take up the complex relationship between the historical and contemporary, introducing the concept of an "Anti-Slavery Project," which builds upon the notion that the present status quo can be traced to both the remarkable achievements, and substantive limitations, of legal abolition.},

It employs social disorganisation theory to examine variations in crime rates between different kinds of rural communities. A typology of rural communities was developed from cluster analysis of demographic, economic and social structural measures of rural local government areas (LGAs) in NSW. Six distinct types of rural communities were found to have unique crime characteristics. Structural measures were statistically associated with four types of crime. Overall, the findings support social disorganisation theory. Crime generally decreased across an urban-rural continuum, and more cohesive and integrated community structures had less crime. One highly disorganised type of small community had extremely high crime.These analyses demonstrate how specific structures of rural places are linked to rural crime.},

Hurricane Iniki, the strongest storm to hit Hawaii in many years, wrought an estimated US{\$} 7.4 billion (2008) in direct damages. Since the unaffected Hawaiian Islands provide a control group, the case of Iniki is uniquely suited to provide insight into the long-term impact of natural disasters. We show that Kauai's economy has yet to recover, 18 years after this event. We estimate the island's current population to be 12 per cent smaller than it would have been had the hurricane not occurred. Similarly, aggregate personal income and the number of private sector jobs are proportionally lower. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

The application of the lex mercatoria or the third legal system, in the absence of any designation of the applicable law, has been recognized as directly or as a substantive criteria. Obviously, it is not permitted to apply lex mercatoria in international contracts without any explicit choice by the parties. The current sources of lex mercatoria are public international law, uniform laws. the general principles of law, rules of international organizations, customs and usages, standard form contracts and reporting of arbitral awards. It has been codified in the form of the Convention on the International Sale of Goods, the UNIDROIT principles as a unofficial international standards and Lord Mustill' list. Lex mercatoria has given a huge impact on international commercial arbitration and become attractive to merchants because it provides a pragmatic approach to coexistence strategies away from legal formalism. Lex mercatoria would be the self-binding law made on the basis of 'party autonomy', 'experience 'and good faith. In 21st century, international commercial arbitration institution which increasingly is preferred in international commercial community is now confronting a big challenge to promote lex mercatoria which formed autonomously in the environment of market logic as a coherent common international regulations as applicable law . Codification and globalization of lex mercatoria as 'a law without law' depends on arbitral award, customs and practices in the future.},

abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

With less than 300 members, it controls a 40,000-strong street army of gangsters eager to throw down and stand up for the cause. It flies the flag of the Black Hand and its business is murder. Although known on the streets for over fifty years, the Mexican Mafia has flown under the radar of the public's awareness and flourished under a deep cover of secrecy. Members are forbidden to even acknowledge its existence. For the first time, in its history, the Mexican Mafia is getting the attention it's been trying to avoid. In this briskly written and thoroughly researched book, Tony Rafael looks at the birth and blood soaked growth of this criminal enterprise through the eyes of the victims, the dropouts and the cops and DAs on the front lines of the battles against the Mexican Mafia. As the first book ever published on the subject, this is a pioneering work that unveils the operations of this California prison gang and how it grew from a small clique of inmates into a transnational criminal enterprise. As the first prison gang to ever project its power beyond prison walls, the Mexican Mafia controls virtually every Hispanic neighborhood in Southern California and is rapidly expanding its influence into the entire Southwest, the East Coast and even into Canada. With law enforcement seemingly powerless to stop it and riding a wave of unchecked immigration, the Mexican Mafia is poised to become the Cosa Nostra of a demographically changing 21st century America.},

The interview instrument was designed to measure subcultural attachment and indicate the degree to which Ss adhered to normative orientations found in prior research on prison subculture. The findings suggest that positive orientations toward inmate subcultural norms in jail settings are mostly attributable to experienced inmates who are already familiar with the norms when they enter the jail and who readapt to the norms after determining that they will not be gaining their freedom immediately.

abstract = {Theory: This paper develops a theory of candidate strategy from social-choice principles and from the workings of open-list proportional representation. The theory is used to explain the campaign behavior and the spatial patterns of vote distribution for candidates to the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. Hypotheses: Campaign strategy is evaluated with models that predict where deputies will offer budget amendments to benefit target municipalities whose votes they seek in subsequent elections. The choice of target municipalities is a function of the cost of erecting barriers to entry, the dominance of the deputy in the municipality, the spatial concentration of the deputy's statewide vote, the vulnerability of the municipality to invasion by outsiders, the weakness of the deputy in the last election, and the deuputy's prior political carreer. Methods: Logistic regression of amendments to the Brazilian national budget in 1989 and 1990 and OLS regression of municipal-level electoral results for the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies in the 1990 elections. Results: Deputies seek secure bailiwicks, search for vulnerable municipalities, and strive to overcome their own electoral weakness by delivering pork. Candidates' tactics vary, partly because political backgrounds differ and partly because the differing demographic and economic contexts of Brazilian states reward some tactitcs and penalize others. Candidate behavior hinders voter control over deputies, increases incentives for pork seeking, and weakens party programs and discipline.},

abstract = {Although recent research has yielded some determining elements to civil war, the influence of political factors on internal conflicts remains disputed. This article presents a critical review of the most widely used indices of democracy in civil war studies, and suggests that the competitiveness of the executive power can be a useful measure for quantitative conflict research. The paper also analyses, by means of statistical regression, the relationship between the competitiveness in the executive recruitment and civil war incidence from 1976 to 2000. The findings indicate that both single-candidate and multi-party elections reduce the incidence of civil war. Furthermore, the results lend support to the hypotheses put forward by recent literature that ethnic fractionalisation, mountainous terrain, large population and centralised political systems significantly heighten the risk of incidence of civil war, while high GDP per capita and economic growth decrease the likelihood of internal conflicts.},

abstract = {In 2012, the two major street gangs in El Salvador, Mara Salvatrucha 13 and Barrio 18, struck a truce credited with reducing homicide rates by more than 50{\%} in one year. Although the gang truce held for only 18 months, the significant reduction in homicides puzzled observers that believed youth gangs were unable to coordinate violence, especially considering that previous and similar efforts aimed at striking agreements did not achieve similar results. This article addresses a question posed by the puzzle of the Salvadoran truce's success: under what conditions do negotiations between or with criminal organizations effectively reduce criminal violence? By comparing truces and criminal pacts in El Salvador and in Medellin, Colombia, we argue that criminal pacts can reduce homicides when (a) they directly involve the state as an administrator of incentives to reduce violence and (b) criminal organizations have achieved organizational cohesion and leadership that facilitate territorial control and strategic dependability. These conditions allow organizations to regulate violence. Our argument highlights the importance of how violence is performed and, more importantly, its visibility, to fully understand criminal behavior within pacts. It also points to potential lessons for countries seeking alternatives to reduce criminal and political violence in Latin America and elsewhere.},

Using historic and interview data, it shows that the changes in the social organiza- tion of these gangs were a reaction to a series of systemic crises in the Soviet and post-Soviet social order.As a result of power deficits, emerging in the space of the streets and in the larger society, the gangs moved through several stages: a) youth peer groups acting out traditional prescriptions of masculine socialisation; (b) ter- ritorial ‘elite' formations; (c) ‘violent entrepreneurs' and (d) autonomous ruling regimes.The article demonstrates that the gangs,while utilising violence to achieve their projects of social and economic domination,may also regulate its use. It argues that the gangs can be seen as historic agents participating in ground-level social regulation, and not simply products and producers of social disorder.},

@book{Gambetta1993,
abstract = {In the Introduction, the author spells out his hypothesis: "the mafia is a specific economic enterprise, an industry which produces, promotes and sells private protection" (p. 1). Though the traditional analogy mafia-state has been based on the use of violence, violence is only a means. Thus, the use of mafia might be a sensible option, the lesser of evils, in some circumstances, though it prevents the long-term birth of trust. This view of the mafia is starkly contrasted with the idea of mafia as legal system in its own right, which seems to be dominant in the judiciary system. Chapter 1 examines the market of protection, i.e. the supply and demand. Mafiosi do not trade information (and therefore are not simple middleman) but guarantees. They can protect buyers and sellers, even in the same transaction, and normally their presence is voluntarily required, as a signal of quality for the seller, as an insurance of quality for the buyer. In case of multiple sellers (i.e. competition), mafiosi typically offer protection only to a selected few, because of scale problems: monitoring costs rise exponentially, and transactions without the direct presence of a mafioso would be the beginning of the creation of trust, the big enemy. Note also that protection against competition can be maintained also through internal agreements, another of the areas where the mafia plays a vital coordinating role. The existence of protected customers will actually increase the number of "lemons" on the market: purchasers will be able to complain only if they have more powerful protection than the sellers, and even if all unprotected customers are lost, the seller still has the protected ones. This increase in lemons will increase the demand for protection. In this scenario extortion might be less an imposition as it sounds: as protection spreads, more people will need to buy it, to avoid being the only ones out (and thus fair game), and mafiosi will need to require payment to avoid free-riding. Alternative explanations (extortion as protection for illegal business and as a cause for lawlessneess) are excluded. Chapter 2 analyses the resources mafiosi would need. First come secrecy and intelligence, essential to be able to protect and threat: omert{\`{a}} is also explained in terms of utilitarian criteria and not of subcultural code. Violence is another resource, and its se does not seem to diminish: the author claims structural factors (instability of the truce between families and new, more violent markets). The third resource, but maybe the most important, is reputation, which in this case reduces the cost of production (=violence). The final resource is advertising, through "sponsorship" of religious celebrations. In chapter 3, the author spells out the "industry analysis". On the customer side, the striking feature is the existence of long-term bonds, because of the very nature of the commodity which is difficult to price. Barriers to entry rest on immobility of the main resource (reputation), which explains the problems of succession, and the impossibility of a separation between ownership and control. Labour is the main input, both temporary and full-time. Monopoly is also preferred and a more rational choice. Chapter 4 delineates the history f the mafia. The author suggests that the breakdown of feudalism (early XIX century), which was not replaced by a central authority brought the class of "protectors" on the market, looking for jobs. In parallel, there emerged a need for policing the peasants and enforcing property rights, especially for traders getting the produce from the countryside to the cities. In the cities, the protectors found that the presence of multiple trades provided them with many opportunities for exploitation of their talents and skills. The relationship between the different mafia families is the subject of chapter 5. Taking a holistic view (total coordination vs. total fragmentation) will not lead us very far, as evidence aginst both interpretation abounds. The mafia itself has fought against the use of general terms, and denied any co-operation, but we can safely assume a moderate degree of coordination: age differences with the heads of other criminal organisations, exchange of labour, trading of resources (especially between city and countryside) all point in this direction. From the end of the 1950s there has been attempts to create inter-family coordinating organisms, to achieve broader co-ordination: this commissione however seems to mostly adjudicate disputes inside families as opposed to across families (and primarily to settle succession wars). There are however a set of industry practices, or norms which are shared by all families, concerning recruitment, reputation, information and language, and rituals. Symbols are rituals are precisely the topic of chapter 6. The most interesting insight is that most of them are borrowed from folklore (I Beati Paoli and Coriolano della Foresta), from cinema (shades, horse's heads), from newspapers and law enforcement (the very term mafia and cosa nostra). The ritual of initiation is also analysed. Chapter 7 examines in detail the nature of the mafiosi protection. Its essence is the settlement of disputes, which can then be extended to the protection of property right (interpreted as resulting from a particular contract). These services are paid for in kind, with cash, or with discounts, purchases on credit, free use of resources or partnerships. Finally, the links with the political world are examined. The drawbacks of this protection are abuses of power, protection of thieves and internecine wars. Chapter 8 examines the impact of the mafia on orderly market. The most common form of intervention is through the creation of collusive agreements, which result in a division of territory, of customers or in rigid turn taking schedules. Four cases are examined: the Palermo fish market (firmly in the hand of the mafia), the fruit and vegetable market (which got away from mafia dominance through the creation of competition, itself a result of the policies of the central authorities), public construction contracts (firmly in the hands of the mafia), and the radio-taxi service (where mafia intervention resulted in the collapse of cooperation). The mafia however also influences the illegal (or disordered) markets. Chapter 9 looks at the influence on mugging (controlled, but not an important activity), smuggling (where the mafia is an important source of credit) and the drug trade (contrary to stereotypes, a main activity). The conclusion develops the links of the mafia to the rural world, both in terms of supply and in customs, rituals and preferred weapons. The author also speculates about the geographical rigidity of the Mafia, which has hardly moved from Sicily (even the American variety is an independent branch, more emerging from the Italo-americans than exported from Sicily). A short digression on the conditions leading to the emrgence (or growth) of the Russian mafia is also presented (and the thesis is that the conditions are quite similar) The book ends on an optimistic note, suggesting that the competition by the state and the internal competition is breaking down the strong hold of the mafia over Sicilian life. If the Italian state manages to muster the motivation to fight consistently against the mafia, we might get to a solution.},

@article{Stuart2010,
abstract = {When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods-or developing methods related to matching-do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

The first briefly reviews the theoretical predictions of currently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second section summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by extensive experimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to show how individuals achieve results that are "better than rational" by building conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and trust can help to overcome the strong temptations of short-run self-interest. The fourth section raises the possibility of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops an initial theoretical scenario, and the final section concludes by examining the implications of placing reciprocity, reputation, and trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.},

abstract = {Haavelmo's seminal 1943 paper is the ˝first rigorous treatment of causality. In it, he distinguished the definition of causal parameters from their identification. He showed that causal parameters are defined using hypothetical models that assign variation to some of the inputs determining outcomes while holding all other inputs ˝fixed. He thus formalized and made operational Marshall's (1890) ceteris paribus analysis. We embed Haavelmo's framework into the recursive framework of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) used in one influential recent approach to causality (Pearl, 2000) and in the related literature on Bayesian nets (Lauritzen, 1996). We compare an approach based on Haavelmo's methodology with a standard approach in the causal literature of DAGs– the "do-calculus" of Pearl (2009). We discuss the limitations of DAGs and in particular of the do-calculus of Pearl in securing identification of economic models. We extend our framework to consider models for simultaneous causality, a central contribution of Haavelmo (1944). In general cases, DAGs cannot be used to analyze models for simultaneous causality, but Haavelmo's approach naturally generalizes to cover it.},

abstract = {The generalizability of empirical findings to new environments, settings or populations, often called “external validity,” is essential in most scientific explorations. This paper treats a particular problem of generalizability, called “transportability”, defined as a license to transfer causal effects learned in experimental studies to a new population, in which only observational studies can be conducted. We introduce a formal representation called “selection diagrams” for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between populations of interest and, using this representation, we reduce questions of transportability to symbolic derivations in the do-calculus. This reduction yields graph-based procedures for deciding whether causal effects in the target population can be inferred from experimental findings in the study population. When the answer is affirmative, the procedures identify what experimental and observational findings need be obtained from the two populations, and how they can be combined to ensure bias-free transport.},

Based upon fieldwork with gangs in London, UK, this article illustrates how recreation, crime, and enterprise are not specific gang ‘types', but rather represent sequential stages in the evolutionary cycle of gangs. This article demonstrates not only how gangs typically begin life as neighbourhood-based peer groups, but also how, in response to external threats and financial commitments, gangs grow to incorporate street-level drug distribution businesses that very much resemble the multi-level marketing structure of direct-selling companies. Gang organisation, in turn, becomes a function of gang business. Gang organisation is conceptualised here on three levels: internal, external, and symbolic. This article examines, respectively, the presence of subgroups, hierarchy and leadership, incentives, rules, responsibilities, and punishments within gangs; how gangs interact with the local and larger community; and how gangs associate with symbolic elements of popular culture in order to convey reputation and achieve intimidation.},

Historical records and a simple game-theoretical model are used to examine this institution.

In such cases, individuals engaging in economic activity with different groups or with others in a single group must develop self-enforcing mechanisms that will induce cooperation, such as abiding by contracts. To understand better the role of the agents' type in self-enforcing exchanges, the author examines here how inmates of the San Pedro Prison in La Paz, Bolivia, where inmates must govern themselves, overcome particularly serious impediments to the establishment of order. The San Pedro Prison case study provides an example of self-governance in prison that results in order because alternative institutional features mitigate violence. The arrangements in San Pedro Prison suggest that self-ordering communities in a prison can establish property rights, vibrant markets, and safety, thereby avoiding the predation highlighted in past research on self-governed prisons.},

The Big Four OMGs are the Hells Angels MC, the Outlaws MC, the Bandidos MC, and the Pagans MC. The first three, although American based, have international chapters and are the largest motorcycle gangs in the world. All four are known for their criminal activity and violence toward each other. There has been little scholarly research on these secret and dangerous motorcycle clubs. This research, utilizing a LexisNexis newspaper search classified the criminal activity of each of the Big Four gangs using a biker criminality typology developed by Quinn and Koch. The study found that the members of the Big Four gangs are involved in a wide range of criminal activities with the most common being ongoing enterprises/organized crime such as drugs and weapons trafficking. There were also numerous instances of spontaneous and planned violent acts against rivals and others. The study added to the limited body of knowledge on these deviant groups and suggests further areas of research. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We then present a model of prison gang organization that accounts for both environmental factors and the endogenous actions of the prison administration, encapsulated in the "warden." We find that gangs organize based on exogenous characteristics. The "warden" diffuses gang influence by maintaining the oligopolistic structure, which limits contraband but allows for orderly private allocation of prison-provided goods and dispute resolution.},

In this article we bridge the gap between causal struc-ture discovery and the do-calculus by proposing a method for the identification of causal effects on the basis of arbitrary (equivalence) classes of semi-Markovian causal models. The approach uses a general logical representation of the equiv-alence class of graphs obtained from a causal structure discovery algorithm, the properties of which can then be queried by procedures im-plementing the do-calculus inference for causal effects. We show that the method is more ef-ficient than determining causal effects using a naive enumeration of graphs in the equivalence class. Moreover, the method is complete with respect to the identifiability of causal effects for settings, in which extant methods that do not re-quire knowledge of the true graph, offer only in-complete results. The method is entirely modular and easily adapted for different background set-tings.},

This violence has been accompanied by a steep increase in rates of kidnapping and extortion and has targeted participants in the narcotics trade as well as government officials, journalists, and civil society activists. Despite the magnitude of the violence and enormous public concern about it, scholarly literature on this topic has been scant. This issue offers some of the most promising analyses conducted thus far on the trends in violence and their causes, focusing largely, though not exclusively, on the role Mexico's government has played in the business of illegal drugs and the violence that accompanies it. In this introduction, we discuss the challenge of deriving reliable statistics on drug-related violence, its spatial and temporal patterns, prevailing explanations, its relationship to organized crime in general, and differences between this violence and substate political violence.},

abstract = {l Tnder anarchy, uncoordinated competitive theft by "roving bandits" destroys the incentive to fJ Zinvest and produce, leaving little for either the population or the bandits. Both can be better off if a bandit sets himself up as a dictator-a "stationary bandit" who monopolizes and rationalizes theft in the form of taxes. A secure autocrat has an encompassing interest in his domain that leads him to provide a peaceful order and other public goods that increase productivity. Whenever an autocrat expects a brief tenure, it pays him to confiscate those assets whose tax yield over his tenure is less than their total value. This incentive plus the inherent uncertainty of succession in dictatorships imply that autocracies will rarely have good economic performance for more than a generation. The conditions necessary for a lasting democracy are the same necessary for the security of property and contract rights that generates economic growth. In my student days, in reading Edward Banfield's (1958) account of the beliefs of the people in a poor village in Southern Italy, I came upon a remarkable statement by a village monarchist. He said, "Monarchy is the best kind of government because the King is then owner of the country. Like the owner of a house, when the wiring is wrong, he fixes it" (p. 26). The villager's argument jarred against my democratic convictions. I could not deny that the owner of a country would have an incentive to make his property productive. Could the germ of truth in the monarchist's argument be reconciled with the case for democracy? It is only in recent years that I have arrived at an answer to this question. It turns out that for a satisfactory answer one needs a new theory of dicta-torship and democracy and of how each of these types of government affects economic development. Once this new theory is understood, one can begin to see how autocracies and democracies first emerge. I shall set out this conception in a brief and informal way and use it to explain some of the most conspic-uous features of historical experience. The starting point for the theory is that no society can work satisfactorily if it does not have a peaceful order and usually other public goods as well. Obvi-ously, anarchic violence cannot be rational for a society: the victims of violence and theft lose not only what is taken from them but also the incentive to produce any goods that would be taken by others. There is accordingly little or no production in the absence of a peaceful order. Thus there are colossal gains from providing domestic tranquility and other basic public goods. These gains can be shared in ways that leave everyone in a society better off. Can we conclude that because everyone could gain from it, a peaceful order emerges by voluntary agreement? From the logic of the matter, we should expect that in small groups a generally peaceful order will nor-mally emerge by voluntary agreement but that in large populations it will not. The key to the matter is that each individual bears the full costs or risks of anything he or she does to help establish a peaceful order or to provide other public goods but receives only a share of the benefits. In a tiny group, such as a hunter-gatherer band, each person or family will obtain a significant share of the benefits of a peaceful order, and the net advantages of such an order are so great that even a single family's share of the gains can easily outweigh the sacrifices needed to obtain it. Moreover, when there are only a few, the welfare of each noticeably depends on whether each of the others acts in a group-oriented way. Thus each fam-ily, by making clear that cooperation by another will bring forth its cooperation but that noncooperation will not, can increase the likelihood that another will match its behavior, thereby increasing the incentive each has to act in the group interest. The theoretical prediction that sufficiently small groups can often organize for collective action is corroborated by countless observations (Olson 1965). This prediction is also in accord with the anthropo-logical observations of the most primitive societies. The simplest food-gathering and hunting societies are normally made up of bands that have, including the children, only about 50 or 100 people. In other words, such a band will normally contain only a few families that need to cooperate. Anthropologists find that primitive tribes normally maintain peace and order by voluntary agreement, and that is to some extent what Tacitus, Caesar, and other classical writ-ers observed among the less advanced Germanic tribes. The most primitive tribes tend to make all important collective decisions by consensus, and many of them do not even have chiefs. When a band becomes too large or disagreement is intense, the band may split, but the new bands normally also make decisions by unanimous consent. If a tribe is in the hunting-and-gathering stage, there is also little or no incentive for anyone to subjugate another tribe or to keep slaves, since captives cannot generate enough surplus above subsistence to justify the costs of guarding them.' Thus within the most primitive tribes of preagricultural history, the logical presump-tion that the great gains from a peaceful order can be achieved by voluntary agreement appears to hold true.},

Abstract Can anarchy be efficient? This paper argues that for reasons of efficiency, rational, wealth-maximizing agents may actually choose statelessness over government in some cases. Where markets are sufficiently thin or where government is prohibitively costly, anarchy i the efficient mode of social organization. If total social wealth under conditions of relatively lower levels of trade is not substantially smaller than it is under conditions of relatively higher levels of trade, the cost of government may exceed the social benefits it provides. Likewise, if the cost of a state is sufficiently large, even substantial differences in social wealth under these two scenarios may prove too small to justify the formation of government from a cost-benefit perspective. The framework I provide explains the persistence of anarchy in two major areas where we tend to observe it: among primitive societies and at the global level. (JEL P48)},

The unprecedented scale of drug-related crime in Mexico has led to its description as an insurgency or even a civil war, a conceptual move that draws on recent studies that have associated civil war with large-scale criminality. By questioning both the ‘‘crime as civil war'' and ‘‘civil war as crime'' models, I argue that instead of folding the two phenomena, we should draw primarily from the micro- dynamics of civil war research program to identify areas of potentially productive cross-fertilization. I point to four such areas, namely, onset and termination, orga- nization, combat and violence, and governance and territory.

Based on the experience of Medellin, Colombia, it is discussed that alongside decades of violence, rapid urbanisation and economic lib- eral reforms, the local state has built capacity for service provision and new governance arrange- ments. But this capacity has not weakened criminal actors' operations and interactions with society and state actors. By focusing on the neighbourhood level, the paper demonstrates the existence of different strategies that have allowed criminals to benefit from governance arrange- ments, originally created to promote participatory democracy and urban development. The paper calls for studies to incorporate the role of criminals in contexts where boundaries between illegal and legal spheres of action, and formal and informal arrangements are continuously blurred.},

Using a time-variant data set of Mexico's cocaine markets at the subnational level and Cox proportional-hazards regressions, I show that when Mexico's democratization decreased the probability of government coordination—the same party governing a municipality at every level of government—drug traffickers were more likely to violate the long-standing informal prohibition on selling cocaine within the country. It was this decrease in government coordination that would set the conditions for a violent war between drug cartels to erupt in the mid-2000s.},

One reason is the capacity of communities to foster cooperative behavior. Com- munities align the individual and collective benefits and costs of people's actions. We model three mechanisms by which communities raise the net benefits to individual pro- social behaviors: reputation , retaliation , and segmentation . Unlike most treatments of the evolution of group-beneficial traits our communities promote pro-social behaviors in the absence of group selection. We further show that the restricted mobility associated with communities ( parochialism ) enhances these mechanisms. Communities are thus specifi- cally adapted to settings that make formal property rights systems untenable and pre- clude the efficient centralized determination of outcomes.},

abstract = {This paper, the first in a series on gangs, provides an overview of the problems that youth gangs pose, identifies the differences between youth gangs and adult criminal organizations, examines the risk factors that lead to youth gang membership, and presents promising strategies being used to curb youth gang involvement. Youth gang problems are proliferating across the United States, even in small cities and towns. At the same time, the composition of youth gangs is changing; smaller, less structured gangs are emerging, and although drug trafficking is generally not an organized activity managed by gangs, drug gangs are more predominant now than in previous decades. The racial/ethnic composition of gangs is also changing, and gangs are becoming more organized. Gang violence, particularly homicide, has increased, owing mainly to the availability and use of more dangerous weapons, especially automatic and semiautomatic handguns. Most gang problems are "homegrown"; gang migration apparently contributes little to local gang problems. Although significant progress is being made in identifying the major risk factors for youth gang involvement, much more information is needed to specify the developmental sequence by which these risk factors operate. This knowledge will be useful in the development of prevention and intervention programs. A key issue in combatting youth gangs is providing a uniform definition for them, which involves distinguishing them from troublesome youth groups and adult criminal organizations. Youth gangs and adult criminal organizations have different origins, and they serve unique purposes for participants. Efforts to develop effective long-term interventions must take these differences into account. 176 references (NCJRS)},

While such criminal actors have sometimes been imagined as heading “parallel states,” I argue that they are part of a hybrid state, an emergent political formation in which multiple governmental actors—in this case, criminal organizations, politicians, police, and bureaucrats—are entangled in a relationship of collusion and divestment, sharing control over urban spaces and populations. Extending recent scholarship on variegated sovereignty and neoliberal shifts in governance, I consider the implications of this diversification of governmental actors for the ways that citizenship is experienced and enacted. The hybrid state both produces and relies on distinct political subjectivities. It is accompanied by a reconfigured, hybrid citizenship, in which multiple practices and narratives related to rule and belonging, to rights and responsibilities, are negotiated by a range of actors.},

abstract = {This article introduces the global Pro-Government Militias Database (PGMD). Despite the devastating record of some pro-government groups, there has been little research on why these forces form, under what conditions they are most likely to act, and how they affect the risk of internal conflict, repression, and state fragility. From events in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria and the countries of the Arab Spring we know that pro-government militias operate in a variety of contexts. They are often linked with extreme violence and disregard for the laws of war. Yet research, notably quantitative research, lags behind events. In this article we give an overview of the PGMD, a new global dataset that identifies pro-government militias from 1981 to 2007. The information on pro-government militias (PGMs) is presented in a relational data structure, which allows researchers to browse and download different versions of the dataset and access over 3,500 sources that informed the coding. The database shows the wide proliferation and diffusion of these groups. We identify 332 PGMs and specify how they are linked to government, for example via the governing political party, individual leaders, or the military. The dataset captures the type of affiliation of the groups to the government by distinguishing between informal and semi-official militias. It identifies, among others, membership characteristics and the types of groups they target. These data are likely to be relevant to research on state strength and state failure, the dynamics of conflict, including security sector reform, demobilization and reintegration, as well as work on human rights and the interactions between different state and non-state actors. To illustrate uses of the data, we include the PGM data in a standard model of armed conflict and find that such groups increase the risk of civil war.},

The data consist of the transcripts of phone intercepts conducted on both groups by the Italian police over several months.

To answer this question, we exploit a unique natural experiment: the 2004 expiration of the U.S. Federal Assault Weapons Ban exerted a spillover on gun supply in Mexican municipios near Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico, but not near California, which retained a pre-existing state-level ban. We find first that Mexican municipios located closer to the non-California border states experienced differential increases in homicides, gun-related homicides, and crime gun seizures after 2004. Second, the magnitude of this effect is contingent on political factors related to Mexico's democratic transition. Killings increased disproportionately in municipios where local elections had become more competitive prior to 2004, with the largest differentials emerging in high narco-trafficking areas. Our findings suggest that competition undermined informal agreements between drug cartels and entrenched local governments, highlighting the role of political conditions in mediating the gun-crime relationship.},

The analysis specifies a structural equation model of delinquency (Matsueda 1982), derives competing hypotheses from the two theories, and estimates a cross-population model for blacks and nonblacks using data from the Richmond Youth Project. Consistent with previous research, we find that broken homes have a larger impact on delinquency among blacks than nonblacks, but, unlike previous studies, our model explains this effect completely. In both populations, the effects of broken homes and attachment to parents and peers are mediated by the learning of definitions of delinquency, a finding that supports differential association over social control theory.},

Conversely, profit sharing should motivate cooperation to increase productivity when work organization facilitates interaction and horizontal monitoring, since productive effort yields positive externalities to workers under contractual surplus sharing. In simultaneous Tobit estimates we find a strong influence of profit sharing on factor productivity in a sample of medium-sized metalworking capitalist firms in West Germany. Proxies for human capital and organizational factors were included. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The completeness proofs of [Huang and Valtorta, 2006] and [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006] and the graphical criteria of [Tian and Shpitser, 2010] have laid this identification problem to rest. Recent explorations unveil the usefulness of the do-calculus in three additional areas: mediation analysis [Pearl, 2012], transportability [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] and metasynthesis. Meta-synthesis (freshly coined) is the task of fusing empirical results from several diverse studies, conducted on heterogeneous populations and under different conditions, so as to synthesize an estimate of a causal relation in some target environment, potentially different from those under study. The talk surveys these results with emphasis on the challenges posed by meta-synthesis. For background material, see http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/csl{\_}papers.html},

Intense migratory flows between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the United States, and the hard-line suppression policies against youth gangs in institutionally weak Central American countries created the conditions that prompted networking and organisation among Central American street gangs. This article highlights the changes in the dynamics of violence and the transformations in the gangs' social spaces to illustrate the evolution of the maras.},

In this article, we discuss the use of the synthetic control method as away to bridge the quantitative/qualitative divide in comparative politics.The synthetic control method provides a systematic way to choose comparison units in comparative case studies. This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows researchers to put “qualitative flesh on quantitative bones.”We illustrate the main ideas behind the synthetic control method by estimating the economic impact of the 1990 German reunification onWest Germany. tarting},

abstract = {This essay and review examines social and cultural factors related to the organization of the prison gang as a means to better understand gangs' criminogenic qualities and its capacity for resisting intervention. Inmates play a large part in the development of prison gang culture, but so do prison guards, their supervisors, the executive leadership of the prison, and regional and statewide administrators. The key to controlling gangs lies in a facility's ability to deal strategically with resource allocation among inmates and staff. This can be accomplished by eliminating the symptoms of disorganization and disorder, provided the effort involves supplanting gang systems with more legitimate ones. A set of gang control tactics and strategies promulgated and implemented by the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) is described. Absent critical empirical study, it is impossible to say whether IDOC's adaptation of the broken windows approach (G. Kelling and C. Coles, 1996) is effective, but an attempt is made to show that it is headed in the right direction.

abstract = {Urban Latin America has become synonymous with violence and insecurity. Whereas levels of violence since 2000, in terms of homicide rates, dropped everywhere else in the world, Latin America and the Caribbean were the exception. Often, efforts to explain this make a connection between poverty, crime, and violence that finds its typical representation in peripheral urban areas: shanty towns. This paper challenges such one-dimensional assumptions by critically examining the complex nexus between violence, insecurity and urban space in urban Latin America. We will define contemporary urban violence in the region and discuss its key characteristics and explanatory factors. Then, we will examine the socio-spatial dimensions of violence and insecurity in three domains: the linkages between criminal gangs, drugs, and violence in peripheral areas; the impact of violence and fear on the strategies of seclusion employed by specific social classes; state responses, especially policing, to show how regimes of public security are differentiated in socio-spatial terms We will argue that these differences reflect differences in citizenship status and citizenship subjectivity, between the privileged and the excluded. This in turn generates bottom-up responses by urban residents that take matters of security and law enforcement in their own hands.},

abstract = {In quantity and importance, private standards are rapidly taking over the role of public norms in the international and national regulation of product safety. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the rise, role and status of these private product safety standards in the legal regulation of integrating markets. In international and regional trade law as in European and American constitutional and administrative law, tort law and antitrust law, the book analyzes the ways in which legal systems can and do recognize private norms as 'law.' This sociological question of law's recognition of private governance is indissolubly connected with a normative question of democratic theory: can law recognize legal validity and democratic legitimacy outside the constitution, without constitutional political institutions and beyond the nation state? Or, can law 'constitute' private transnational governance? The book offers the first systematic treatment of European, American and international 'standards law' in the English language, and makes a significant contribution to the study of the processes of globalization and privatization in social and legal theory. For the thesis on which this book was based, Harm Schepel was awarded the first EUI Alumni Prize for the: "best interdisciplinary and/or comparative thesis on European issues" written at the EUI in recent years.},

abstract = {Despite problems of violence domestically, Brazil has played a key leadership role as part of MINUSTAH peacekeeping operations in Haiti since 2004. This article addresses how Brazil's international military engagement is shaping domestic approaches to urban security, and what may be the implications of the use of military strategies, operations, and norms to address issues of public security in Brazilian cities. It is argued that current approaches toward urban security employing military-trained peacekeepers actually represent a continuation of old paradigms, yet these recent militarised approaches are likely evolving into newer and potentially more accountable forms by constraining indiscriminate use of force and establishing a positive state presence in marginal urban areas. As such, the article connects long-established issues of dealing with urban violence in Latin America with ongoing debates in the United States and beyond about post-counterinsurgency approaches to increasingly urban conflict settings. It reflects on potential lessons to be learned from the Latin American perspective, while showing also how these have changed over the last decade. The article concludes that despite the potential utility of force in some urban conflict settings, this approach could entail a normative shift towards legitimising forceful containment of violence, and hinder democratic consolidation in Brazil.},

abstract = {This essay examines a period of crisis in the national penitentiary system in Honduras, during emergency campaigns designed to combat transnational gangs, called maras. Emergency laws led to the incarceration of mara members by the thousands, overcrowding prisons and overburdening their already precarious architecture and design. I explore the ideological and material ruins of incarceration, wherein irregular bodies of sovereign force (death squads legitimized by emergency) and new expressions of criminal community (maras) offer divergent incarnations of political power. The essay's title phrase, "gothic sovereignty," invokes this perennial reemergence of death squads from the crypts of state power and the criminal aesthetics cultivated within the prison itself, as the maras reclaim sovereign power at the scale of the community. After several massacres targeting mara members in state penitentiaries, the intensified decoration of gang members' bodies with tattoos of devils, clowns, and satanic symbols thrust the grammar of protest in Honduran politics to a limit where the architecture of confinement became a laboratory for criminal affects and political horizons projecting beyond the sociopolitical dimensions of the nation-state in crisis. {\textcopyright} 2014 Duke University Press.},

abstract = {THE AUSTRIAN TRADITION is represented in modern economics by a "very vocal, feisty and dedicated subset of the economics profession" (Karen Vaughn 1994, p. xi). Much of the work of this group of scholars is devoted to the most fundamental problems of micro- economics.' This Austrian work, therefore, differs in character and content from a good deal of neoclassical theory which, despite widespread and growing awareness of its limitations, continues to serve as the analytical core of main-stream economics. This paper sets forth the outlines of one important approach within modern Austrian economics, an approach offering a perspective on microeconomic theory which (while it has generated a considerable literature of its own) is not ordinarily well-represented either at the (mainstream) textbook level, or in the (mainstream) journal literature. Although the author subscribes to and has contributed to this approach, the purpose of this paper is exposition, not advocacy. References in the paper to criticisms of mainstream microeco- nomics which have been discussed in the Austrian literature should be understood here not as arguments in favor of the Austrian approach, but as clues that may be helpful in understanding what the Austrians are saying, and how what they are saying is to be distinguished from the approach taken by other modern economists. This paper does not offer anything like a survey of modern Austrian economics. What will emerge from this paper is thus the exposition of an Austrian way of understanding the systematic character of markets which, while sharply differing from the mainstream competitive equi- librium model, does not necessarily see that model as totally irrelevant. (Many practical questions, such as those regard- ing the effects of price controls, mini- mum wage laws, and the like, can be an- swered quite adequately without going beyond simple competitive supply-and- demand equilibrium models.) The dy- namic competitive process of en- trepreneurial discovery (which is the driving element in this Austrian ap- proach) is one which is seen as tending .systematically toward, rather than away from, the path to equilibrium. Therefore, the standard, competitive equilibrium model may be seen as more plausible as an approximate outcome, in the Austrian theory here presented." This as pect of the entrepreneurial discovery approach troubles a number of the Austrian economists who have not accepted it. In order to clearly locate the entrepreneurial discovery perspective within the range of modern Austrian theoretical points of view, it will be necessary briefly to identify more precisely the various disagreements which other Austrians have had with this approach. mists (such as Mises and Murray Rothbard) of a concept (the "evenly rotating economy") which parallels that of the equilibrium state, see Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink (1985). Section II of this paper will review the Austrian criticisms of the equilihrium emphasis of the neoclassical models. Section III will develop the Austrian understanding of the market process, based upon the twin concepts of sheer (i,e,, unknown) ignorance and entrepreneurial discovery. Section IV will survey several areas of applied microeconomics (anti- trust economics, welfare economics, the theory of justice, and the possibility of socialist economic calculation), taking special note of the significant differences which the Austrian approach entails in regard to pohcy recommendations in these areas. Section V will note the various criticisms to the entrepreneurial discovery theory developed in this paper, offered by several contemporary Austrian economists. Section VI concludes the paper by clearing up certain misunderstandings concerning the Austrian approach.},

abstract = {Research indicates that Islam is the fastest growing religion among prisoners in Western nations. In the United States, roughly 240,000 inmates have converted to the faith since the 9/11 attacks. According to federal law enforcement, Saudi-backed Wahhabi clerics have targeted these prisoners for terrorist recruitment. The present research examines this claim from several different perspectives. First, it reviews the literature on prisoner conversions to Islam and concludes that there are opposing viewpoints on the matter. One side of the debate takes an alarmist stance, arguing that prisons have become incubators for Islamic terrorism; the other side asserts that Islam plays a vital role in prisoner rehabilitation. Second, results of a two-year study of prisoner radicalization and terrorist recruitment in US prisons are reported. The motives for prisoner conversions to Islam are discussed along with the effects of conversion on inmate behaviour; the role played by gangs and charismatic leaders in radicalizing prisoners; and the social processes by which inmates move from radicalization to operational terrorism. Third, two case studies are presented. One involves a terrorist plot waged by a gang of Sunni prisoners at California's New Folsom Prison; the other looks at the inmate-led Islamic Studies Program at Old Folsom Prison, which has adopted a de-radicalization agenda. It is argued that inmate self-help programmes may do more than the state to prevent radicalization and terrorist recruitment behind bars.},

abstract = {Despite Brazil's electoral laws, which would appear to encourage incumbency, legislative turnover in Brazil consistently exceeds 50{\%} with each election. In this article, I explain this phenomenon as a function of two factors: the nature of political ambition and the dynamics of electoral competition. Political ambition accounts for about half of the turnover because a sizeable portion of incumbent legislators decides to run for nonlegislative office. Electoral competition accounts for the other half. Since many potentially strong candidates for reelection decide to run for another office the group of incumbents running for reelection is relatively weak. In addition, a wide-open nomination process ensures that incumbents running for reelection face a pool of extremely strong challengers. Finally, Brazil's at-large, open-list proportional representation electoral system undermines incumbents' attempts to protect their status. Given these factors, many incumbents lose. I provide evidence for the impact of ambition and competition on legislative turnover in Brazil, place Brazil in comparative perspective, and suggest avenues for further research.},

abstract = {What kind of war is Mexico's drug war? The prominent “criminal insurgency” approach helpfully focuses attention on cartel–state conflict, but unnecessarily redefines insurgency as “state-weakening,” eliding critical differences in rebels' and cartels' aims. Whereas rebels fight states, and cartels fight with one another, to conquer mutually prized territory and resources, cartels fight states “merely” to constrain their behavior and influence policy outcomes. This distinction yields a typology with theoretical consequences: decisive victory plays an important role in most models of civil war but is impossible or undesirable in wars of constraint. Theories of criminal war must therefore explain how ongoing coercive violence can be preferable to pacific strategies. I distinguish two such coercive logics of cartel–state conflict: violent lobbying and violent corruption. Lobbyings' more universalistic benefits elicit free riding, so turf war among cartels should make it rarer than violent corruption. This prediction accords with qualitative and quantitative evidence from Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil.},

It is contended that prisons are relatively stable, disturbances occurring no more frequently than do civil disturbances. A desire for stability is shared by prisoners and guards and is provided through accommodative relationships between inmate leaders and the prison administration. In exchange for their assistance in maintaining order, the leaders are granted a certain amount of autonomy. A major facet of the resultant informal system of control is the contraband market, the basis of the informal social system and a form of legitimate governance that enhances stability. In this examination of prison leaders and the types of power they exercise over inmate behavior, it is asserted that the informal system promotes manipulation and dishonesty among prisoners and staff, causing a situation in which stability is dependent on informalities and illegalities, and it is maintained that a more formalized sense of legitimacy among inmates is required. It is suggested that this could be accomplished through a more direct relationship between inmates and the prison hierarchy in decision-making processes.

@article{Olson2004,
abstract = {This report provides an overview of the findings from a study that examined the rates and patterns of rearrest and reincarceration among gang members released from Illinois prisons in November 2000 (n=2,534 inmates). The information on the inmates obtained from the Illinois Department of Corrections included demographic characteristics, marital and educational status, history of drug use, conviction offense, institutional data, and whether the inmate was considered to be an active gang member. Just over 26 percent of the sample were identified as current/active gang members. The Illinois State Police provided information on each inmate's criminal history, including arrests prior to and after their incarceration. Data were obtained on any arrests between an inmate's release data in November 2000 and January 2003. By the end of this period, 75 percent of the gang members had been rearrested for a new offense, compared with 63 percent of the nongang members. Gang members tended to be rearrested sooner after release than the nongang members. Fifty-five percent of the gang members were readmitted to prison within the follow-up period, compared to 46 percent of the nongang members. Most of the gang members were returned to prison for a new offense rather than a technical violation of parole. Gang membership continued to have an effect on recidivism when other risk factors were controlled. Recidivism was most likely to be associated with drug-related and violent offenses. One strategy for addressing this situation is to increase the focus of parole and law enforcement resources on gang members just released from prison. 1 table, 3 figures, and 34 references},

abstract = {This article presents the problem of gangs on the island of Puerto Rico from a historical, economical, and political perspective. Some Puerto Rican historians are convinced that the gang problem in Puerto Rico is due to the political ambiguity and human rights violations of prison inmates (F. Pico, 1998). Some social scientists believe that gangs are not a widespread problem in Puerto Rico. Their claim is supported by the fact that the only literature about gangs that can be found in Puerto Rican libraries is in newspapers and not in academic literature (De Jesus Mangual, 2002; Serrano, 2002). This article argues that gangs do exist in Puerto Rico and shed light on the problem from a historical perspective. It concludes with a list of recommendations for counselors based on the article's analysis and review of literature.},

On this basis several contrasts are drawn between representative, consolidated democracies and the democratic (i.e., polyarchical) forms that are emerging in most newly democratized countries, East and South. From this perspective, various phenomena not presently theorized (except as deviations from a presumed modal pattern of democratization) are discussed. Concepts such as delegative democracy, low-intensity citizenship and a state which combines strong democratic and authoritarian features are introduced for the purpose of that discussion.},

Then as now, proponents of profit-sharing claimed that its use helped increase employee work effort and decrease labour/management tensions, thereby promoting better company performance (Gilman, 1891, 1899). While tbe idea of profit sharing has existed for over a century, the practice of profit sharing is not dominant in Western industrialised countries. Nonetheless it continues to be established in many companies, and in recent years has received new attention, partly as a potential means of dealing witb lagging productivity growth.'{\^{}} How profit sharing actually affects employee work effort and productivity, though, is still an open question.

In the last two decades, much research has been done on the econometric and statistical analysis of such causal effects. This recent theoretical literature has built on, and combined features of, earlier work in both the statistics and econometrics literatures. It has by now reached a level of maturity that makes it an important tool in many areas of empirical research in economics, including labor economics, public finance, development economics, industrial organization, and other areas of empirical microeconomics. In this review, we discuss some of the recent developments. We focus primarily on practical issues for empirical researchers, as well as provide a historical overview of the area and give references to more technical research.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Historical records show that the Sicilian mafia developed to protect land from predatory attacks at a time when publicly provided security was scarce and banditry widespread. Using a common-agency model, this article shows that (i) it is optimal for each landowner to voluntarily buy protection even if this results in a worse equilibrium for the landowning class and (ii) all things equal, mafia profits are higher where land is more fragmented. The argument is based on the fact that protection involves an externality, in the sense that by buying protection, each landowner deflects thieves on others' properties. Using qualitative data from a parliamentary survey (1881), the article also shows that in 19th century rural Sicily the mafia was in fact more likely to be active in towns where land was more divided.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The illegal narcotics trade in Los Angeles has flourished despite its inability to rely on state-based formal institutions of governance. An alternative system of governance has emerged from an unexpected source—behind bars. The Mexican Mafia prison gang can extort drug dealers on the street because they wield substantial control over inmates in the county jail system and because drug dealers anticipate future incarceration. The gang's ability to extract resources creates incentives for them to provide governance institutions that mitigate market failures among Hispanic drug-dealing street gangs, including enforcing deals, protecting property rights, and adjudicating disputes. Evidence collected from federal indictments and other legal documents related to the Mexican Mafia prison gang and numerous street gangs supports this claim.},

Intense migratory flows between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and the United States; and the hard-line suppression policies against youth gangs in institutionally weak Central American countries created the conditions that prompted networking and organization among Central American street gangs.},

Most past work consists of case studies, limiting the generalizations from the results. The present study used data from 371 state prisons and measures of both individual and collective violence and attempted to identify the structural, managerial, and environmental determinants of prison disorder. Findings suggest that poor prison management is a predictor of rates of assault toward inmates and staff. However, the likelihood of prison riots is largely independent of structural, managerial, and environmental factors. The article also discusses the implications for public policy.},

abstract = {An important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time. In order to allocate a given budget optimally, for example, an advertiser must determine the incremental contributions that different advertising campaigns have made to web searches, product installs, or sales. This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In con- trast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including the time-varying influence of contemporane- ous covariates, i.e., synthetic controls. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on synthetic data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by evaluating the effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our approach in improving the accuracy of causal at- tribution, power analyses, and principled budget allocation.},

Data were derived from one author‘s six-year full-member participation as a correctional officer in the California prison system. We examine tattoos specific to members of the Nuestra Familia, a California-based prison gang. Tattoos make an individual's self-definition more complete by visually communicating gang membership, status, rank, and personal accomplishments; they reflect a person's past career accomplishments and possible future career objectives. To analyze the moral careers communicated by these tattoos, we identi?/ and elaborate upon five distinct phases in a prison gang moral career: pre-initiate, initiate, member, veteran, and superior. The article concludes with discussion of the importance of incorporating symbolic self-completion into an identity work perspective and consideration of some implications for future research on gang tattoos in particular and identity construction more generally.

abstract = {How do income shocks affect armed conflict? Theory suggests two opposite effects. If labour is used to appropriate resources violently, higher wages may lower conflict by reducing labour supplied to appropriation. This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is the rapacity effect. Our article exploits exogenous price shocks in international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict.We examine changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labour intensive) as well as natural resources (which are not).We focus on Colombia's two largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil shock inducing a rapacity effect.We also show that this pattern holds in six other agricultural and natural resource sectors, providing evidence that price shocks affect conflict in different directions depending on the type of the commodity.},

In such markets there is an incentive for sellers to reduce quality and take short-run gains before buyers catch on. In order to forestall such quality cutting, the price-quality schedule involves high quality items selling at a premium above their cost. This premium also serves the function of compensating sellers for their investment in reputation. The effects of improved consumer information and of a minimum quality standard on the equilibrium price-quality schedule are studied. In general, optimal quality standards exclude from the market items some consumers would like to buy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Inmates use a combination of norms and organizations to provide governance privately. Norms rely on decentralized information transmission and enforcement mechanisms. Organizations, on the other hand, have well-defined memberships and create explicit information transmission and enforcement mechanisms. Inmates cannot rely on norms for governance when the inmate population is large, increasingly crowded, and when fewer inmates arrive with a prior prison commitment. When norms fail, inmates create organizations to protect themselves and provide governance. Once these groups have the power to deter predators, they prey on others.

abstract = {Although Southern California's Latino gangs are not the oldest street gangs in the United States, they are among the most emulated and fastest- growing. The members of the first Latino street gangs in California, which formed more than a hundred years ago, were of Mexican descent.1 It is a long distance, both in time and type, from these early, loosely structured, neighborhood groups of disaffected immigrant youths to the power and violence of today's Mexican Mafia prison gang, for instance. Research suggests that street gangs can evolve and change as they grow in size and expand their illegal business activities-for example, by becoming more organized and developing a vertical command structure.2 Transnational criminal activities like human, arms, and drug trafficking; the theft of intellectual property; and money laundering have provided new venues for the operations of some street gangs, while the opportunity for these kinds of employment is an incentive for gang members to migrate within and between countries.3 The growing connection between the prison community and the drug cartels operating on the street also offers plenty of employment opportunities for gang members. Police and judicial crackdowns on gang activity in the United States and many Central American countries, notably El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, have set up what is essentially a revolving door by which gang members convicted of crimes in the United States are deported to the country of their birth, only to turn around quickly and make their way back north, often through human or drug trafficking pipelines. This circular flow of criminals has spread the especially violent maras gangs throughout the Western Hemisphere, resulting in what may be called the globalization of violent urban gang culture. This chapter begins with a look at the origins and evolution of the most notorious "Sure{\~{n}}o" street gangs of Southern California, Mara Salvatrucha (from which the term mara became generalized) and the 18th Street Gang (also known as Calle Dieciocho, Barrio 18, or Calle 18). The chapter then examines the growing role of drugs in gang culture, both at the level of street- corner dealing, which is how most gang members are involved, and at the level of international trafficking, which has been greatly facilitated by cooperation between some gangs and Mexican drug cartels. It examines the concept of the globalization of gangs, as a consequence of both law enforcement practices and criminal enterprise, and explores the relationship between Latino street gangs and the Mexican Mafia, a gang centered primarily in California prisons that has close ties to the Mexican drug cartels. The chapter goes on to describe the various peer, societal, and legal pressures that shape contemporary gang culture and how that culture continues to evolve under these and other influences. Finally, the chapter draws some conclusions about the ways in which gang culture has changed and the directions it might take in the future.

The fundamental barrier to success turns out not to be recruiting suicide attackers; there is a rational basis for volunteering. Rather, the barrier is the danger of other operatives defecting. A club model, portraying voluntary religious organizations as efficient providers of local public goods, explains how they weed out potential defectors by requiring sacrifices as signals of commitment. They are thereby able to succeed in risky terrorist attacks. The model has testable implications for tactic choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebel organizations. Data spanning a half-century on both terrorists and civil war insurgents, much from Middle East sources and Israel/Palestine, reveal that: a) missions organized by radical religious clubs that provide benign local public goods are both more lethal and are more likely to be suicide attacks than missions organized by other terrorist groups with similar aims and theologies; and b) suicide attacks are chosen when targets are " hard, " i.e., difficult to destroy. Our results suggest benign tactics to counter radical religious terrorism and insurgency.},

The empirical analysis shows that the theoretical determinants of a firm's decision to operate or intensify profit-sharing schemes are relevant to the theoretical model. Furthermore, it confirms that profit-sharing schemes improve productivity, but have ambiguous effects on employment.},

The article describes the main features of the two facets, offers a brief overview of the development of these ideas, and clarifies their relationship to Public Choice theory and alternative visions of public goods analysis, public administration, and governance. The argument goes further to raise the provocative question whether the two “social philosophies” involved in the approach undertaken by Elinor Ostrom and Vincent Ostrom are necessarily and inseparably connected with the rest of their research program.},

In each country, there is an idiosyncratic way of constructing youth violence and juvenile delinquency. Also, each coun- try has its own manner of reaction to those problems. In El Salvador youths are socially constructed as a threat to security, and the state implements predominantly repressive policies to protect citizens against that threat. In Nicaragua and Costa Rica, where the social discourse on youth violence is less prominent, the state's policies are neither very accentuated nor very coherent, whether in terms of repressive or nonrepressive measures. There are strong relationships and mutual influences between the public's fear (or disregard) of youth violence and the state's policies to reduce it.},

We discuss the use of propensity score-matching methods, and implement them using data from the National Supported Work experiment. Following {\{}LaLonde{\}} (1986), we pair the experimental treated units with nonexperimental comparison units from the {\{}CPS{\}} and {\{}PSID{\}}, and compare the estimates of the treatment effect obtained using our methods to the benchmark results from the experiment. For both comparison groups, we show that the methods succeed in focusing attention on the small subset of the comparison units comparable to the treated units and, hence, in alleviating the bias due to systematic differences between the treated and comparison units.},

abstract = {The analysis of how institutions are formed, how they operate and change, and how they influence behavior in society has become a major subject of inquiry in politics, sociology, and economics. A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions. Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed. The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.},

abstract = {Has the Mexican government's policy of removing drug-trafficking organization (DTO) leaders reduced or increased violence? In the first 4 years of the Calder{\'{o}}n administration, over 34,000 drug-related murders were committed. In response, the Mexican government captured or killed 25 DTO leaders. This study analyzes changes in violence (drug-related murders) that followed those leadership removals. The analysis consists of cross-sectional time-series negative binomial modeling of 49 months of murder counts in 32 Mexican states (including the federal district). Leadership removals are generally followed by increases in drug-related murders. A DTO's home state experiences more subsequent violence than the state where the leader was removed. Killing leaders is associated with more violence than capturing them. However, removing leaders for whom a {\$}30m peso bounty was offered is associated with a smaller increase than other removals. DTO leadership removals in Mexico were associated with an estimated 415 additional deaths during the first 4 years of the Calder{\'{o}}n administration. Reforming Mexican law enforcement and improving career prospects for young men are more promising counter-narcotics strategies. Further research is needed to analyze how the rank of leaders mediates the effect of their removal.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Hellman2003,
abstract = {September 2000 In a decade of transition, fear of a leviathan state is giving way to increased focus on oligarchs who capture the state. In the capture economy, the policy and legal environment is shaped to the captor firm's huge advantage, at the expense of the rest of the enterprise sector. This has major implications for policy. The main challenge of the transition has been to redefine how the state interacts with firms, but little attention has been paid to the flip side of the relationship: how firms influence the state-especially how they exert influence on and collude with public officials to extract advantages. Some firms in transition economies have been able to shape the rules of the game to their own advantage, at considerable social cost, creating what Hellman, Jones, and Kaufmann call a capture economy in many countries. In the capture economy, public officials and politicians privately sell underprovided public goods and a range of rent-generating advantages a la carte to individual firms. The authors empirically investigate the dynamics of the capture economy on the basis of new firm-level data from the 1999 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), which permits the unbundling of corruption into meaningful and measurable components. They contrast state capture (firms shaping and affecting formulation of the rules of the game through private payments to public officials and politicians) with influence (doing the same without recourse to payments) and with administrative corruption (petty forms of bribery in connection with the implementation of laws, rules, and regulations). They develop economywide measures for these phenomena, which are then subject to empirical measurement utilizing the BEEPS data. State capture, influence, and administrative corruption are all shown to have distinct causes and consequences. Large incumbent f...irms with formal ties to the state tend to inherit influence as a legacy of the past and tend to enjoy more secure property and contractual rights and higher growth rates. To compete against these influential incumbents, new entrants turn to state capture as a strategic choice-not as a substitute for innovation but to compensate for weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework. When the state underprovides the public goods needed for entry and competition, captor firms purchase directly from the state such private benefits as secure property rights and removal of obstacles to improved performance-but only in a capture economy. Consistent with empirical findings in previous research on petty corruption, administrative corruption-unlike both capture and influence-is not associated with specific benefits for the firm. The focus of reform should be shifted toward channeling firms' strategies in the direction of more legitimate forms of influence, involving societal voice, transparency reform, political accountability, and economic competition. Where state capture has distorted reform to create (or preserve) monopolistic structures supported by powerful political interests, the challenge is particularly daunting. This paper-a product of the Governance, Regulation, and Finance Division, World Bank Institute; the Public Sector Group, Europe and Central Asia Region; and the Office of the Chief Economist, European Bank of Reconstruction and Development-is part of an empirical project on governance in transition.},

The increase in criminal violence in the region since the return to democratic rule makes this a timely question. Several scholars have demonstrated the impact of a series of variables (political performance, economic performance, interpersonal trust, perception of corruption) on citizens' support for political institutions (system support). The goal of this study is to assess the impact of two additional variables (victimization and perception of violence) that have been neglected in the literature. I test the impact of exposure to violence on system support by using survey data from the 2004 edition of the Latin American Public Opinion Project. My findings demonstrate that both victimization and high perception of violence have a negative impact on system support in Latin America.},

Citizens who perceive the state as legitimate are likely to consider its institutions a valid source of morality and social control. Theoretically, legitimacy should play an important role in criminal offending across countries. This link between state power and citizens—that is, legitimacy—has the potential to be an important social mechanism connecting state actions to individual criminal behaviours. With this in mind, this article explores how political legitimacy might affect levels of crime and violence across countries. A lack of legitimacy may lead citizens to (1) reject the monopoly of physical force to employ self-help and/or (2) withdraw commitment from institutions, breaking down social control.},

Most discussions of corruption link it to aspects of political culture and traditionalism or backwardness. Within this perspective, Brazil is seen as a dualistic society divided between an urban, modern sector in the center and south and a traditional and backward sector in the north and northeast. Within each area, different types of voting behavior prevail: issue-oriented or ideological in the modern sector, and elite-dominated and exchange-oriented in the traditional. Corruption has increased while the political culture has changed little and traditionalism has, if anything, declined. The formative experiences of the two men who have occupied the presidency since the end of military rule in the clientele-based politics of the backward north and northeast no doubt help to explain their personal values and norms of behavior. Thus far, the authors have discussed circumstances that make corruption, broadly defined, more important to presidents.},

abstract = {The present work aims to understand the process of expansion and consolidation of the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) in S{\~{a}}o Paulo prison system and the social figuration that is formed in prisons as a result of the monopolization of the opportunities by the power of PCC. To this end, concepts and theoretical conceptions of Norbert Elias are used as analytical tools for the treatment of empirical data collected from various sources. The work consists of two lines of analysis: axis horizontal / vertical axis and procedural / figurational. The horizontal axis analytical or procedural approaches the phenomenon from a macro- sociological point of view, which focuses on the social development of the PCC with a view to social, political and administrative problems that are directly or indirectly linked to it. Also as part of the analysis area, the expansion of the PCC is considered in terms of several steps that compose it, owing to the role of direct physical violence in the exercise of its power. The vertical axis or figurational analysis aims at understanding the social dynamics produced from this process. Whereas a social figuration as a starting point of analysis, called figuration "pre- PCC", tried to show the changes in the prison world, which constituted a new social figuration. The new social representation produced from the hegemony of the PCC consists of a web of a longer and more complex individual interdependence, with greater functional division and social integration among its components. Given this new form of dependency, the social controls on individual behavior have been expanded and centralized in the position occupied by the PCC. The structure and organization of the PCC, its political dynamics and social control which takes the form of imposition of individual self-control are central issues in this part of the work. The vertical axis is concluded with a discussion of the dependence of the PCC in the face of the prison administration, where the device Regime Disciplinar Diferenciado (RDD) is central in maintaining the balance of power that ensures the hegemony of the PCC and the stability of the order social of the prison. A reflection that permeates all the work that is developed in the final chapter calls into question the social pacification that is seen as the most significant effect of the consolidation of power of the PCC. In this sense, the fragility of this process is identified from its contextual nature and the precarious foundations on which rests the hegemonic power of the PCC.},

Drug trafficking organizations continue to operate effectively despite incentives for members to defect, pressure from dam- aged communities, and government interdiction efforts. This paper identifies the problem of defection in this context and applies insights from the literatures on club goods and ex- tralegal governance institutions to explain the puzzling organization and activities of one of Mexico's most dangerous drug trafficking organizations, La Familia Michoacana.The group uses a reward and punishment scheme to prevent defection from members and to elicit cooperation from the community and government.},

We focus on empirical work that seeks to test the basic coverage-risk prediction of adverse selection theory?that is, that policyholders who purchase more insurance coverage tend to be riskier. The analysis of this body of work, we argue, indicates that whether such a corre lation exists varies across insurance markets and pools of insurance policies. We discuss various reasons why a coverage-risk correlation may not be found in some pools of insurance policies. The presence of a coverage-risk correlation can be explained either by moral hazard or adverse selection, and we discuss methods for distinguishing between them. Finally, we review the evidence on learning by policyholders and insurers.},

abstract = {A study investigates gang membership in New Zealand prisons. Included is a case study of Auckland Maximum Security Prison (Paremoremo). Data were gathered from earlier studies, the 1989 prison census and unpublished materials. Compared with other inmate groups, gang members tend to: be younger, convicted of violent offenses, and classified as requiring medium or maximum custody; serve longer sentences; have a greater number of previous convictions and first convictions at an earlier age; and spend a greater proportion of their adult lives in prison. At Auckland, gangs have been blamed for exacerbating the difficulties of emotionally fragile inmates by creating a climate of fear and intimidation. The prisons have no policy of actively trying to dissuade inmates from continuing their gang involvement. That membership carries no automatic negative consequences means that gangs have remained visible and consequently more easily managed. New Zealand has a long history of gangs. Prison gangs are arms of gangs that exist in the community. Because the latter show few signs of disappearing, it seems likely that gangs will continue to play a prominent role in the prisons.},

A major consequence of this was the increasing use of heroin among Mexican American gang members and their transformation from autonomous youth gangs to extensions of the adult prison gangs or their demise. Data was collected from 160 members of 26 Mexican American youth gangs and key informants in San Antonio. Findings focus on organizational rules, drug market transformations, consequences on members, and the impact of heroin on the gang's organization. Discussed is how the dominance of prison gangs is related to the increased incarceration and recidivism rates of Mexican Americans and declining economic opportunities for urban minorities.},

It con- tinues introducing possible instances of polycentricity as well as related notions, as part of an attempt to further elaborate the concept through a concept design approach that systematically applies the logic of necessary and sufficient conditions. The article concludes by arguing that the poly- centricity conceptual framework is not only a robust analytical structure for the study of complex social phenomena, but is also a challenging method of drawing non-ad hoc analogies between different types of self-organizing complex social systems.},

The Mexican Mafia prison gang can extort drug dealers on the street because they wield substantial control over inmates in the county jail system and because drug dealers anticipate future incarceration. The gang's ability to extract resources creates incentives for them to provide governance institutions that mitigate market failures among Hispanic drug-dealing street gangs, including enforcing deals, protecting property rights, and adjudicating disputes.

Such lending or trade credit is modeled as a second layer of financial intermediation. It is shown that when it is costly for a bank to inspect the borrower's revenue but not for the borrower's business partner, then saving in monitoring costs due to the business partner's informational advantage may lead to trade credit. The trade off is between monitoring fewer firms and monitoring larger firms that may entail an adverse scale effect. The results are consistent with the existing empirical evidence on bankruptcy costs and on the incidence of trade credit. Welfare analysis in terms of total surplus shows that the equilibrium lending arrangement is not necessarily optimal. ?? 2001 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.},

abstract = {Reviews the book by Donna Goldstein (2003). This book defies simple categorization: on one level it is a broadranging discussion of class, race and sexuality and the intimacy of their imbrications; on another it is an intimate ethnography of the life of Gl{\'{o}}ria, a domestic worker who lives in a Rio de Janeiro shantytown with up to 14 children in her care. The description of Gl{\'{o}}ria's life is graphic, inimate and uncompromising in its depiction of the poverty, impotence, and fatigue that afflicts her. Gl{\'{o}}ria suffers; but in equal measure the reader gets a sense of a woman with a strong sense of purpose, with courage, and a powerful sense of agency. One of the greatest strengths of this book is the way it offers a sense of the paradox of agency and impotence in equal measure; and avoids falling into a vision of Gl{\'{o}}ria either as an example of heroic quiet resistance on the one hand or defeatist resignation on the other. Consequently, the book can be read as a series of very readable vignettes about Gl{\'{o}}ria and her children which give a moving picture of the life of a black woman in a Brazilian favela. This is a book which is accessible and challenging and is to be highly recommended: it is a must on any race and gender course but will equally be of interest to those scholars and students of Latin America, anthropology and sexuality.

There is no need for concern about "other" sources of bias, e.g., unreliability of X , unmeasured background variables. If the conditional expecta- tions are parallel and linear, the proper regression adjust- ment is the simple covariance adjustment. However, since the quality of the resulting estimates may be sensitive to the adequacy of the underlying model, it is wise to search for nonparallelism and nonlinearity in these conditional expectations. Blocking on the values of X is also appropriate, although the quality of the resulting estimates may be sensitive to the coarseness of the blocking employed. In order for these techniques to be useful in practice, there must be either substantial overlap in the distribution of X in the treatment groups or strong prior information.},

Dramatic increases in homicide rates followed rises in inequality, more young men in the population, greater availability of firearms, and increased drug use. Nevertheless, disarmament legislation may have helped reduce homicide rates in recent years. Despite its very high rate of lethal violence, Brazil appears to have similar levels of general criminal victimization as several other Latin American and North American countries. Brazil has lower rates of drug use compared to other countries such as the United States, but the prevalence of youth drug use in Brazil has increased substantially in recent years. Since 1990, the growth of the Brazilian prison population has been enormous, resulting in the fourth largest prison population in the world. Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified 10 studies assessing the prevalence of self-reported offending in Brazil and 9 studies examining risk factors. Levels of self-reported offending seem quite high among school students in Brazil. Individual and family-level risk factors identified in Brazil are very similar to those found in high-income countries. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

In recent years the group has acquired a reputation for extreme brutality and has ostensibly mutated into a fast-expanding, transnational organized crime network with possible ties to international terrorists. Drawing on key concepts in gang research and multiple methodological tools, this article seeks to sharpen understanding of MS-13's structure and activities. While the group is active in many countries, it is transnational only in a symbolic manner, not in its configuration or span of authority. Impelled largely by Central American gang-suppression policies, MS-13 has evolved from a traditional street gang into a group with organized crime characteristics, but it remains a social phenomenon rooted in urban marginality. Ultimately, a more nuanced picture of Mara Salvatrucha can inform the search for more effective gang policies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In nearly two-thirds of civil wars since 1989, governments have received support in their counterinsurgency operations from militias. Many scholars predict higher levels of violence in conflicts involving pro-government militias because governments are either unable or unwilling to control militias. This article challenges this view, arguing that governments can and do often control militia behavior in civil war. Govern- ments make strategic decisions about whether to use violence against civilians, encouraging both regular military forces and militia forces to target civilians or restraining regular military forces and militia forces from attacking civilians. In some cases, however, government and militia behavior differs. When a militia recruits its members from the same constituency as the insurgents, the militia is less likely to target civilians, as doing so would mean attacking their own community. Statistical analyses, using new data on pro-government militia violence in civil wars from 1989 to 2010, support these arguments.},

The high variance of crime rates across time and space is one of the oldest puzzles in the social sciences; this variance appears too high to be explained by changes in the exogenous costs and benefits of crime. We present a model where social interactions create enough covariance across individuals to explain the high cross-city variance of crime rates. This model provides an index of social interac-tions which suggests that the amount of social interactions is highest in petty crimes, moderate in more serious crimes, and almost negligible in murder and rape.

Ethnic defection can have important effects on conflict outcomes, but its causes have been understudied. Using Sunni defection in Iraq as a theory-developing case, this article offers a theory of "fratricidal flipping" that identifies lethal competition between insurgent factions as an important cause of defection. It examines the power of the fratricidal-flipping mechanism against competing theories in the cases of Kashmir and Sri Lanka. These wars involve within-conflict variation in defection across groups and over time. A detailed study of the empirical record, including significant fieldwork, suggests that fratricide was the dominant trigger for defection, while government policy played a secondary role in facilitating pro-state paramilitarism. Deep ideological disagreements were surprisingly unimportant in driving defection. The argument is probed in other wars in Asia. The complex internal politics of insurgent movements deserve careful attention.},

abstract = {The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries. ==== This study looks at the problem of collectively managing shared resources. Because of the book's unassuming nature and rather formal scholarly tone, it's easy to pass it over as just another academic work. But together with such books as Herman Daly and John Cobb's For the Common Good, Paul Hawken's The Ecology of Commerce and Vandana Shiva's work on restoring the commons, I consider it one of the more far-sighted and genuinely significant works to emerge in recent years on environmental resource management. Ostrom uses the term "common pool resources" to denote natural resources used by many individuals in common, such as fisheries, groundwater basins, and irrigation systems. Such resources have long been subject to overexploitation and misuse by individuals acting in their own best interests. Conventional solutions typically involve either centralized governmental regulation or privatization of the resource. But, according to Ostrom, there is a third approach to resolving the problem of the commons: the design of durable cooperative institutions that are organized and governed by the resource users themselves. "The central question in this study," she writes, "is how a group of principals who are in an interdependent situation can organize and govern themselves to obtain continuing joint benefits when all face temptations to free-ride, shirk, or otherwise act opportunistically." The heart of this study is an in-depth analysis of several long-standing and viable common property regimes, including Swiss grazing pastures, Japanese forests, and irrigation systems in Spain and the Philippines. Although Ostrom insists that each of these situations must be evaluated on its own terms, she delineates a set of eight "design principles" common to each of the cases. These include clearly defined boundaries, monitors who are either resource users or accountable to them, graduated sanctions, and mechanisms dominated by the users themselves to resolve conflicts and to alter the rules. The challenge, she observes, is to foster contingent self-commitment among the members: "I will commit myself to follow the set of rules we have devised in all instances except dire emergencies if the rest of those affected make a similar commitment and act accordingly." This book is aimed chiefly at policy-makers, bureaucrats, and resource users, rather than scholars. Ostrom is concerned with the effective management of common property resources, rather than explanatory theories. Throughout the book, she stresses the dangers of overly generalized theories of collective action, particularly when used "metaphorically" as the foundation for public policy. The three dominant models — the tragedy of the commons, the prisoners's dilemma, and the logic of collective action — are all inadequate, she says, for they are based on the free-rider problem where individual, rational, resource users act against the best interest of the users collectively. These models are not necessarily wrong, Ostrom states, rather the conditions under which they hold are very particular. They apply only when the many, independently acting individuals involved have high discount rates and little mutual trust, no capacity to communicate or to enter into binding agreements, and when they do not arrange for monitoring and enforcing mechanisms to avoid overinvestment and overuse. Ostrom concludes that "if this study does nothing more than shatter the convictions of many policy analysts that the only way to solve common pool resource problems is for external authorities to impose full private property rights or centralized regulation, it will have accomplished one major purpose."

Posted on January 4, 2011 by admin Summary: Looks at the problem of collectively managing shared resources (i.e. “common pool resources”). While conventional studies typically involve either centralized governmental regulation or privatization of the resources, Ostrom proposes a different approach to resolving the problem: the design of durable cooperative institutions that are organized and governed by the resource users themselves. Outlines 8 design principles common to the four cases (although she's not yet persuaded that they are necessary conditions, further research might show that (or something similar) to be the case). Method: Case studies. In-depth analysis of several long-standing and viable common property regimes, including Swiss grazing pastures, Japanese forests, and irrigation systems in Spain and the Philippines. The case studies include both successful and unsuccessful ways of managing the commons, illustrating the diversity of possible solutions. ‘Important Insight': Especially in the case of the smaller scale common pool resources that are the focus of the enquiry, the three dominant models to explain collective action – the tragedy of the commons, the prisoner's dilemma, and the logic of collective action (Olson) – are less useful for characterising the behaviour of appropriators. Here, the repeated and enduring communication and interaction of individuals in a localised physical setting can, if resulting in the development of shared norms and patterns of reciprocity, form the social capital with which the institutional arrangements for resolving CPR dilemmas can be built. Critique Notes from reviews: key point: looks at the problem of collectively managing shared resources (i.e. “common pool resources”). While conventional studies typically involve either centralized governmental regulation or privatization of the resources, Ostrom proposes a different approach to resolving the problem: the design of durable cooperative institutions that are organized and governed by the resource users themselves. The central question in the study thus becomes: how is it that a group of principals who are in an interdependent situation can organize and govern themselves to obtain continuing joint benefits when all face temptations to free-ride, shirk, or otherwise act opportunistically.
